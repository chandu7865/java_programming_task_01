DOMAIN : JAVA PROGRAMMING

DURATION : 20th JUNE-20th AUG 2024

    The objectives of the Java program designed as a basic calculator are as follows:
    
User Interaction: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Input Handling: It reads the user's input for numbers and operation choice using the Scanner class from the standard input (System.in).
Operation Execution: Based on the user's choice, the program performs the selected arithmetic operation:
Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies the two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second (handles division by zero).
Output: After performing the operation, the program displays the result to the user.
Error Handling: It includes basic error handling to prevent division by zero, which is not allowed in arithmetic.
User Experience: The program provides a clear menu of choices and outputs the result in a readable format, enhancing the user experience.
Basic Structure: The program demonstrates the use of fundamental Java constructs such as variables, input/output handling, conditional statements (switch-case), and basic arithmetic operations.
By achieving these objectives, the program serves as a simple yet functional calculator application, allowing users to perform common arithmetic operations interactively through the command line.
